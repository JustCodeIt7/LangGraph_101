    "# Example 3: Advanced Iterative Code Generation with Human Debugging\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Create a sophisticated LangGraph that iteratively generates Python code, automatically runs unit tests, and engages human expertise when tests fail. The human provides debugging guidance, and the AI incorporates this feedback to fix the code. This process continues until all tests pass, demonstrating advanced human-AI collaboration in software development.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "- Automated code generation from specifications\n",
    "- Automatic unit test execution and result analysis\n",
    "- Human debugging interface with error analysis\n",
    "- Iterative code improvement based on human feedback\n",
    "- Code quality assessment and optimization\n",
    "- Comprehensive error handling and safety measures"
