# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression

### Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in unlabeled data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties

## Popular Algorithms
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
