- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation and learning guide
- **`requirements.txt`** - Required Python dependencies
- **`run_tutorial.py`** - Easy-to-use runner script with error checking

## 🎯 Tutorial Features

### Core Functionality
✅ **Human Approval Workflow** - Interactive approval system for risky operations
✅ **Risk-Based Tool Categorization** - Automatic classification of safe vs. approval-required tools
✅ **Session Management** - Persistent state across approval cycles
✅ **Comprehensive Statistics** - Tracking of all approval decisions and tool usage
✅ **Interactive Commands** - Rich command interface for approval management

### Tools Implemented
- **🔒 Approval Required**: `send_email`, `delete_file`, `make_purchase` (>$50)
- **✅ Auto-Execute**: `get_weather`, `calculate_tip`, small purchases (<$50)

### Interactive Features
- Individual action approval/denial
- Batch operations (approve/deny all)
- Detailed action inspection
- Session statistics tracking
- Real-time conversation flow

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management
```python
class HumanInLoopState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]
    user_name: str
    pending_actions: List[dict]
    approved_actions: List[dict]
    denied_actions: List[dict]
    session_stats: dict
    awaiting_human: bool
```

### Graph Flow
```
initialize → agent → analyze → [approval?] → execute → response → END
```

### Key Components
1. **Risk Analysis Engine** - Categorizes tools by safety level
2. **Approval Interface** - Interactive human decision system  
3. **Execution Manager** - Handles approved and safe tool execution
4. **Response Generator** - Creates contextual responses based on outcomes

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Safe Operation (Auto-Execute)
```
User: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
→ Immediate execution, no approval needed
```

### Risky Operation (Approval Required)
```
User: "Send email to team@company.com about project update"
→ Pauses for human approval
→ Interactive approval interface
→ Execution upon approval
```

### Mixed Operations
```
User: "Check weather in Paris and email the forecast to John"
→ Weather: Auto-executed
→ Email: Requires approval
```

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Granular Control** - Approve/deny individual actions
- **Risk Assessment** - Automatic categorization by potential impact
- **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all decisions
- **Timeout Protection** - Graceful handling of approval delays
- **Error Recovery** - Robust error handling throughout workflow
