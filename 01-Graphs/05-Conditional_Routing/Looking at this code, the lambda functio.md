## Lambda Function 1: Router Node

```python
graph.add_node("router", lambda s: s)
```

**What it does**: This is a **passthrough function** that takes the state `s` and returns it unchanged.

**Purpose**:
* **Node Functionality**: Every node in LangGraph must be a function that processes state.
* **Routing Mechanism**: The `add_conditional_edges()` method uses the `route_by_sign()` function to determine the next path.
* **Router Node Purpose**: The "router" node exists to enable the attachment of conditional edges and doesn't transform data.

**Flow**:
* State enters the router node.
* Router node passes the state through unchanged.
* `add_conditional_edges()` calls `route_by_sign()` to identify the next node.
* State flows to the appropriate processing node (square_node, abs_node, or zero_node).

## Alternative Approach

Instead of using lambda functions, you could define explicit functions:

```python
def passthrough_router(state):
    return state

graph.add_node("router", passthrough_router)
```
