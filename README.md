## üí° Quick Start Examples

### Basic Graph Structure

This example demonstrates the fundamental structure of a LangGraph `StateGraph`.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, List

# Define your state
class WorkflowState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str
    steps: List[str]

# Create a node function
def start_node(state: WorkflowState) -> dict:
    return {"steps": ["started"]}

# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
builder.add_node("start", start_node)
builder.set_entry_point("start")
builder.set_finish_point("start")

app = builder.compile()
```

### Chat Application with LLM

This snippet illustrates how to initialize an LLM for use in a LangGraph application. See the complete example in `01-Graphs/07-Basic_Chat_Graph/` for full details.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_litellm import ChatLiteLLM

# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatLiteLLM(
    model="ollama/qwen3:0.6b",
    api_base="http://localhost:11434",
    temperature=0.7,
)

# ... (see complete example in 01-Graphs/07-Basic_Chat_Graph/)
```
