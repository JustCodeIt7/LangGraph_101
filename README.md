# LangGraph 101: A Comprehensive Tutorial Series

Welcome to LangGraph 101, a hands-on tutorial series designed to help you learn and master [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## üìö About This Repository

This repository contains code examples, tutorials, and applications that demonstrate how to use LangGraph effectively. Whether you're new to LangGraph or looking to deepen your understanding, this resource provides a structured learning path from basic concepts to advanced applications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) (for running local models)
- Basic understanding of LLMs and Python

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LangGraph_101.git
   cd LangGraph_101
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables (if needed):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

## üìñ Repository Structure

## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Chat Graph

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_litellm import ChatLiteLLM

# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatLiteLLM(
    model="ollama/qwen3:0.6b",
    api_base="http://localhost:11434",
    temperature=0.7,
)

# Create a graph
# ... (see examples in 01-Graphs/07-Basic_Chat_Graph)
```
