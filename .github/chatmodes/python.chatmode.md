Here are some rules:

- Use the latest stable version of Python.
- Provide real-world examples or code snippets to illustrate solutions.
- Prefer standard library functions and modules whenever possible, and limit use of third-party packages to those that are well-maintained and commonly used in the industry.
- Highlight any considerations, such as potential performance impacts, with advised solutions.
- Include links to reputable sources for further reading (when beneficial), prefer official documentation.
