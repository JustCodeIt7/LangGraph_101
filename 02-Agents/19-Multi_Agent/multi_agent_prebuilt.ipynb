    "# Multi-Agent System with LangGraph\n",
    "In multi-agent systems, agents interact through handoffs, a mechanism that determines which agent receives control and what data is transferred to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular multi-agent architectures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Supervisor:** A central supervisor agent oversees individual agents, managing all communication and task delegation. It decides which agent to activate based on the current context and task needs.\n",
    "-  **Swarm:** Agents dynamically transfer control to one another based on their expertise. The system tracks the last active agent to ensure subsequent interactions continue with that agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of the `multi_agent_prebuilt.py` script:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This script showcases three distinct approaches to building multi-agent systems:\n",
    "1. **Supervisor Pattern:** A central supervisor agent assigns tasks to specialized agents.\n",
    "2. **Swarm Pattern:** Agents directly pass tasks to each other as needed.\n",
    "3. **Custom Handoffs:** A detailed implementation of task handoffs between agents."
