    "# Interrupts and Commands in LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create human-in-the-loop workflows using LangGraph's `interrupt` and `Command` features. We'll build a workflow that pauses for user approval and dynamically routes based on the user's decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interrupts**: Pause graph execution and wait for human input\n",
    "- **Commands**: Dynamically control graph routing and execution flow\n",
    "- **Checkpointing**: Required for interrupts to save and restore state\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our workflow will:\n",
    "1. Present a task for approval\n",
    "2. Pause execution and wait for user decision\n",
    "3. Route to completion or cancellation based on the decision"
