## Introduction
This is a sample document for testing the RAG Agent. It contains information about artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Machine Learning Basics
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing algorithms that can learn from data. There are three main types:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data to train models
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns through interaction with environment

## Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. It has been particularly successful in:

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing (like AlphaGo)

## Applications
AI and ML are used in many fields:
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, drug discovery
- Finance: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles
- Technology: Recommendation systems, virtual assistants

## Conclusion
The field of AI and ML continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs happening regularly.

## Python
Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in:
- Data science and machine learning
- Web development
- Automation and scripting
- Scientific computing

## JavaScript
JavaScript is the language of the web. It's used for:
- Frontend web development
- Backend development (Node.js)
- Mobile app development
- Desktop applications

## SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing relational databases. Key operations include:
- SELECT: Retrieve data
- INSERT: Add new data
- UPDATE: Modify existing data
- DELETE: Remove data

## Best Practices
- Write clean, readable code
- Use version control (Git)
- Test your code
- Document your work
- Follow coding standards
