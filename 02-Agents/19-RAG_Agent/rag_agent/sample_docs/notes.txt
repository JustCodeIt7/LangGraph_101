Deep Learning Notes
==================

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers.

Key concepts:
- Backpropagation
- Gradient descent
- Activation functions
- Convolutional layers
- Recurrent layers

Applications:
- Computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Speech recognition
- Game playing (AlphaGo, etc.)
