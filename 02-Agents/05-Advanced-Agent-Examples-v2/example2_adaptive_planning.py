LangGraph Advanced Agent Example 2: Adaptive Planning Agent

This script demonstrates an adaptive planning agent that can:
1. Create dynamic plans that evolve based on execution results
2. Adapt to unexpected situations and pivot strategies
3. Learn from failures and adjust approaches
4. Handle uncertainty and incomplete information

Scenario: Project Management Agent
- Takes a complex project goal (e.g., "Launch a mobile app")
- Creates initial plan with milestones and dependencies
- Executes plan steps while monitoring for blockers and risks
- Adapts plan dynamically when issues arise
- Learns from execution patterns to improve future planning
