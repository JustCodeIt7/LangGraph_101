## üöÄ Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install langgraph langchain_openai langchain_core typing_extensions
```

Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Execution

Run any example individually:

```bash
# Original research assistant
python 05-Advanced-Agent-Examples.py

# Collaborative multi-agent system
python example1_collaborative_agents.py

# Adaptive planning agent  
python example2_adaptive_planning.py

# Hierarchical reasoning agent
python example3_hierarchical_reasoning.py
```

Each script provides an interactive session where you can input different scenarios and observe the agent's behavior.
