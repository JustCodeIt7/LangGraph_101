# LangGraph Human-in-the-Loop Agents Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to build LangGraph agents that require human approval for critical actions, implementing proper oversight and control mechanisms.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this tutorial, you will learn:

1. **Human Oversight Implementation**: How to build agents that pause for human approval
2. **Risk-Based Tool Categorization**: Separating safe tools from those requiring approval
3. **Interactive Approval Workflows**: Managing complex approval processes
4. **State Management with Interrupts**: Handling conversation flow with human intervention
5. **Security and Control**: Implementing proper safeguards for AI agents

## 🔧 Features Demonstrated

### Tool Categories
- **🔒 Approval Required Tools**: 
  - `send_email`: Email sending functionality
  - `delete_file`: File deletion operations
  - `make_purchase`: Financial transactions (>$50)

- **✅ Safe Tools (Auto-Execute)**:
  - `get_weather`: Weather information retrieval
  - `calculate_tip`: Mathematical calculations
  - Small purchases (<$50)

### Human Oversight Features
- **Interactive Approval Process**: Review and approve/deny individual actions
- **Batch Operations**: Approve or deny all pending actions at once
- **Detailed Action Review**: Inspect tool calls before approval
- **Session Statistics**: Track approval rates and tool usage
- **Persistent State**: Maintain conversation context across approvals

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install langgraph langchain-openai langchain-core
```

### Environment Setup
Set your OpenAI API key:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Running the Tutorial
```bash
python 04-Human-in-the-Loop.py
```

## 📋 Tutorial Structure

### Part 1: Tool Definition with Risk Levels
- Creating tools that require different levels of approval
- Implementing risk-based categorization
- Special handling for conditional approval (e.g., purchase amounts)

### Part 2: Enhanced Agent State
- State management for human oversight
- Tracking pending, approved, and denied actions
- Session statistics and user context

### Part 3: Human Checkpoint Nodes
- **Initialize**: Set up oversight state
- **Analyze**: Categorize tool requests by risk level
- **Approval**: Interactive human approval interface
- **Execute**: Run approved and safe tools
- **Response**: Generate contextual responses

### Part 4: Intelligent Routing
- Conditional routing based on approval requirements
- State-aware decision making
- Approval workflow management

### Part 5: Graph Construction
- Building the complete human-in-the-loop workflow
- Implementing approval checkpoints
- Managing conversation flow

## 🎮 Interactive Features

### Command Interface
- **approve all**: Approve all pending actions
- **deny all**: Deny all pending actions
- **approve <number>**: Approve specific action by number
- **deny <number>**: Deny specific action by number
- **details <number>**: View detailed information about an action

### Session Commands
- **stats**: View current session statistics
- **demo**: See example scenarios
- **exit**: End the session with summary

## 💡 Example Scenarios

### 1. Safe Tool Usage
```
User: "What's the weather in New York?"
Result: Auto-executed (no approval needed)
```

### 2. Email Approval Required
```
User: "Send an email to john@example.com about the meeting"
Result: Pauses for human approval before sending
```

### 3. Smart Purchase Handling
```
User: "Buy a coffee for $4.50"
Result: Auto-approved (under $50 threshold)

User: "Buy a laptop for $1200" 
Result: Requires human approval (over $50)
```

### 4. Mixed Tool Scenarios
```
User: "Check the weather and then email the forecast to the team"
Result: Weather auto-executed, email requires approval
```

## 🔒 Security Features

### Risk-Based Execution
- **Immediate execution** for safe, read-only operations
- **Human approval** for actions with potential consequences
- **Conditional logic** for context-aware decisions

### Audit Trail
- Complete logging of all approval decisions
- Session statistics tracking
- Action timestamp recording

### User Control
- Granular approval control (individual actions)
- Bulk operations (approve/deny all)
- Detailed action inspection before approval

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### State Management
```python
class HumanInLoopState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List, add_messages]
    user_name: str
    pending_actions: List[dict]
    approved_actions: List[dict]
    denied_actions: List[dict]
    session_stats: dict
    awaiting_human: bool
```

### Approval Workflow
```
initialize → agent → analyze → [approval?] → execute → response → END
                                   ↑            ↓
                              (if needed)  (when ready)
```

### Tool Categorization
```python
APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS = {"send_email", "delete_file", "make_purchase"}
SAFE_TOOLS = {"get_weather", "calculate_tip"}
```

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Human-in-the-Loop Design Patterns
1. **Checkpoint Pattern**: Strategic pause points for human input
2. **Risk Assessment**: Automatic categorization of actions by risk level
3. **Conditional Approval**: Context-aware approval requirements
4. **State Persistence**: Maintaining context across interruptions
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Handling approval denials smoothly

### Best Practices Demonstrated
- Clear separation of safe vs. risky operations
- Intuitive approval interfaces
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Flexible approval granularity
- User-friendly error handling

## 🔄 Workflow Explanation

1. **User Input**: User makes a request
2. **LLM Processing**: AI determines required tools
3. **Risk Analysis**: Tools categorized by approval needs
4. **Conditional Routing**: 
   - Safe tools → Direct execution
   - Risky tools → Human approval
5. **Approval Interface**: Interactive review of pending actions
6. **Execution**: Run approved and safe tools
7. **Response Generation**: Contextual response with results
