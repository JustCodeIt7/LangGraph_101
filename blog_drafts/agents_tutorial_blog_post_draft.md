# Building Robust LangGraph Agents

The **02-Agents** portion of LangGraph 101 dives into creating autonomous and collaborative agents. Each tutorial showcases different patterns for managing state, streaming outputs, and coordinating multiple agents.

## Running Agents
Start with the fundamentals of agent execution. Examples cover synchronous and asynchronous runs, streaming tokens, and recursion limits.

## Agent State
These tutorials explore how to track tasks and maintain conversation context across steps, even when several agents share information.

## Streaming Responses
Learn about multiple streaming modes, from simple token streaming to tool update streams. Examples show how to combine streaming techniques for responsive apps.

## Tools
The tools tutorial explains how to build and customize function tools, handle errors gracefully, and leverage advanced features like hidden arguments or forced tool use.

## Human-in-the-Loop
For workflows that require manual oversight, youâ€™ll see patterns for basic approval and intermediate editing workflows.

## Multi-Agent Workflows
LangGraph supports coordinating multiple agents. Examples demonstrate sequential collaborations, supervisor-worker delegation, and even debates among agents.

## Advanced Examples and RAG
To round things out, the tutorials include advanced agent patterns and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation agent that lets you chat with your own documents.

Together these lessons provide a comprehensive look at constructing intelligent agents with LangGraph.
