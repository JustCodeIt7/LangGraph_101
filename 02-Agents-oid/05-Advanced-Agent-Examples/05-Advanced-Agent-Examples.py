LangGraph Advanced Agent Examples Tutorial

This interactive script demonstrates advanced agent concepts:
1. Reflection/Self-Correction: Agent critiques and refines its work.
2. Multi-step Planning and Execution: Agent creates a plan, executes steps,
   and potentially re-plans.
3. Complex State Management: Managing more intricate state variables.
4. Sophisticated Tool Use: Using tools as part of a larger plan.

Scenario: A Research Assistant Agent
- Takes a research topic.
- Creates an initial research plan.
- Executes plan steps (e.g., simulated web search).
- Reflects on the gathered information and plan execution.
- Refines information or re-plans if necessary.
- Generates a final research summary.

# (Adjusted node logic mentally, will reflect in final code if this were iterative.
